Usage:
    See abmb_example.m and abmu_example.m

Requirements:
    Matlab (Octave won't work)

Code Organization:
    The code is organized into separate paths that roughly correspond to functionality.
    In particular:

    - 'src/': This folder contains all the files necessary for ABM-U/ABM-B to run.
              - 'abmb.m': runner for "ABM-B"
              - 'abmu.m': runner for "ABM-U"
              - 'abm_interface.m': definition of what an interface struct
              - 'build_interfaces.m': this function assembled all the interfaces required
                                      for ABM-B/ABM-U (called by the runners)
              - 'run_abm.m': this function actually performs the simulation for ABM-B/ABM-U
                             (called by the runners)

    - 'data/': This folder contains the data files (e.g., refractive indices) that are needed
               to run ABM-B or ABM-U. All are available here: http://www.npsg.uwaterloo.ca/data/leaves.php
               - 'caro-PAS-400-2500.txt': Specific absorption coefficient of carotenoids (400-2500nm)
               - 'cellulose400-2500.txt': Specific absorption coefficient of cellulose (400-2500nm)
               - 'chloAB-DFA-400-2500.txt': Specific absorption coefficient of chlorophyll a+b (400-2500nm)
               - 'sacwH400-2500.txt': Specific absorption coefficient of water (400-2500nm)
               - 'raH400-2500.txt': Refractive index (real part) of antidermal cell wall (400-2500nm)
               - 'rcH400-2500.txt': Refractive index (real part) of epicuticular wax (400-2500nm)
               - 'rmH400-2500.txt': Refractive index (real part) of wet mesophyll wall (400-2500nm)

    - 'samples/': This folder contains data definitions for samples used for testing of ABM-U/ABM-B.
                  All samples correspond to those mentioned in http://www.npsg.uwaterloo.ca/resources/docs/rse2006.pdf.
               - 'lopex_0141_0142.m': Soybean (Soja hispida or Glycine max), a bifacial leaf for ABM-B
               - 'lopex_0219_0220.m': Corn (Zea mays L.), a unifacial leaf for ABM-U

Notes: 
    - The simulation uses the parallel computing toolbox. If you want to make use
      of a multicore machine, you will want to run the command 'matlabpool open'
      before executing the abmb or abmu functions. This allows matlab to perform the
      simulation on all cores available.

    - All concentrations are specified in g/cm^3, and lengths in meters.

    - Data is linearly interpolated across 400-2500nm, with data points every five nanometers.
